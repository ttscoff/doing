## What and why

`doing` is a basic CLI for adding and listing "what was I doing" reminders in a [TaskPaper-formatted](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper) text file. It allows for multiple sections/categories and flexible output formatting.

While I'm working, I have hourly reminders to record what I'm working on, and I try to remember to punch in quick notes if I'm unexpectedly called away from a project. I can do this just by typing `doing now tracking down the CG bug`. 

If there's something I want to look at later but doesn't need to be added to a task list or tracker, I can type `doing later check out the pinboard bookmarks from macdrifter`. When I get back to my computer --- or just need a refresher after a distraction --- I can type `doing last` to see what the last thing on my plate was. I can also type `doing recent` (or just `doing`) to get a list of the last few entries. `doing today` gives me everything since midnight for the current day, making it easy to see what I've accomplished over a sleepless night.

_Side note:_ I actually use the library behind this utility as part of another script that mirrors entries in [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) that have the tag "wwid." I can use the hourly writing reminders and enter my stuff in the quick entry popup. Someday I'll get around to cleaning that up and putting it out there.

## Installation

    $ [sudo] gem install doing

Only use `sudo` if your environment requires it. If you're using the system Ruby on a Mac, for example, it will likely be necessary. If `gem install doing` fails, then run `sudo gem install doing` and provide your administrator password.

Run `doing config` to open your `~/.doingrc` file in the editor defined in the $EDITOR environment variable. Set up your `doing_file` right away (where you want entries to be stored), and cover the rest after you've read the docs.

See the [support](#support) section below for troubleshooting details.

## The "doing" file

The file that stores all of your entries is generated the first time you add an entry with `doing now` (or `doing later`). By default the file is created in "~/what_was_i_doing.md", but this can be modified in the config file.

The format of the "doing" file is TaskPaper-compatible. You can edit it by hand at any time (in TaskPaper or any text editor), but it uses a specific format for parsing, so be sure to maintain the dates and pipe characters. 

Notes are anything in the list without a leading hyphen and date. They belong to the entry directly before them, and they should be indented one level beyond the parent item. When using the `now` and `later` commands on the command line, you can start the entry with a quote and hit return, then type the note and close the quote. Anything after the first line will be turned into a TaskPaper-compatible note for the task and can be displayed in templates using `%note`.

Notes can be prevented from ever appearing in output with the global option `--no-notes`: `doing --no-notes show all`.

## Configuration

A basic configuration looks like this:

    ---
    doing_file: /Users/username/Dropbox/nvALT2.2/?? What was I doing.md
    current_section: Currently
    default_template: '%date: %title%note'
    default_date_format: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'
    views:
      color:
        date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P'
        section: Currently
        count: 10
        wrap_width: 0
        template: '%boldblack%date %boldgreen| %boldwhite%title%default%note'
        order: desc
    templates:
      default:
        date_format: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'
        template: '%date | %title%note'
        wrap_width: 0
      today:
        date_format: '%_I:%M%P'
        template: '%date: %title%odnote'
        wrap_width: 0
      last:
        date_format: '%_I:%M%P on %a'
        template: '%title (at %date)%odnote'
        wrap_width: 0
      recent:
        date_format: '%_I:%M%P'
        template: '%date > %title%odnote'
        wrap_width: 50
    :include_notes: true


The config file is stored in "~/.doingrc", and is created on the first run. 

### Doing file location

The one thing you'll probably want to adjust is the file that the notes are stored in. That's the `doing_file` key:

    doing_file: /Users/username/Dropbox/nvALT2.2/?? What was I doing.md

I keep mine in my nvALT folder for quick access and syncing between machines. If desired, you can give it a `.taskpaper` extension to make it more recognizable to other applications. (If you do that in nvALT, make sure to add `taskpaper` as a recognized extension in preferences).

### "Current actions" section

You can rename the section that holds your current tasks. By default, this is "Currently," but if you have some other bright idea, feel free:

    current_section: Currently

### Default editors

The setting `editor_app` only applies to Mac OS X users. It's the default application that the command `doing open` will open your WWID file in. If this is blank, it will be opened by whatever the system default is, or you can use `-a app_name` or `-b bundle_id` to override.

In the case of the `doing now -e` command, your $EDITOR environment variable will be used to complete the entry text and notes. Set it in your `~/.bash_profile` or whatever is appropriate for your system:

    export EDITOR="mate -w"

The only requirements are that your editor be launchable from the command line and able to "wait." In the case of Sublime Text and TextMate, just use `-w` like this: `export EDITOR="subl -w"`.

### Templates

The config also contains templates for various command outputs. Include placeholders by placing a % before the keyword. The available tokens are:

- `%title`: the "what was I doing" entry line
- `%date`: the date based on the template's "date_format" setting
- `%shortdate`: a custom date formatter that removes the day/month/year from the entry if they match the current day/month/year
- `%note`: Any note in the entry will be included here, a newline and tabs are automatically added.
- `%odnote`: The notes with a leading tab removed (outdented note)
- `%hr`: a horizontal rule (`-`) the width of the terminal
- `%hr_under`: a horizontal rule (`_`) the width of the terminal
- `%[color]`: color can be black, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan or white
    - you can prefix "bg" to affect background colors (%bgyellow)
    - prefix "bold" and "boldbg" for strong colors (%boldgreen, %boldbgblue)
- `%interval`: when used with the `-t` switch on the `show` command, it will display the time between a timestamp or `@start(date)` tag and the `@done(date)` tag, if it exists. Otherwise, it will remain empty.

Date formats are based on Ruby [strftime](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html#method-i-strftime) formatting.

My normal template for the `recent` command looks like this:

    recent:
      date_format: '%_I:%M%P'
      template: '%date > %title%odnote'
      wrap_width: 88

And it outputs:
    
    $ doing recent 3
     4:30am > Made my `console` script smarter...
        Checks first argument to see if it's a file, if it is, that's the log

        Else, it checks the first argument for a ".log" suffix and does a search in the user
        application logs with `find` for it.

        Otherwise, system.log.

        I also made an awesome Cope wrapper for it...
    12:00pm > Working on `doing` again.
    12:45pm > I think this thing (doing) is ready to document and distribute
    $ 

You can get pretty clever and include line breaks and other formatting inside of double quotes. If you want multiline templates, just use "\n" in the template line and after the next run it will be rewritten as proper YAML automatically.

For example, this block:

    recent:
      date_format: '%_I:%M%P'
      template: "\n%hr\n%date\n > %title%odnote\n%hr_under"
      wrap_width: 100

will rewrite to:

    recent:
      date_format: '%_I:%M%P'
      template: |2-

        %hr
        %date
         > %title%odnote
        %hr_under
      wrap_width: 100

and output my recent entries like this:

    $ doing recent 3
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     4:30am
     > Made my `console` script smarter...
        Checks first argument to see if it's a file, if it is, that's the log

        Else, it checks the first argument for a ".log" suffix and does a search in the user application
        logs with `find` for it.

        Otherwise, system.log.

        I also made an awesome Cope wrapper for it...

### Custom views

You can create your own "views" in the `~/.doingrc` file and view them with `doing view view_name`. Just add a section like this:

    views:
      old:
        section: Old
        count: 5
        wrap_width: 0
        date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P'
        template: '%date | %title%note'
        order: asc
        tags: done finished cancelled
        tags_bool: ANY

You can add additional custom views, just nest them under the "views" key (indented two spaces from the edge). Multiple views would look like this:

    views:
      later:
        section: Later
        count: 5
        wrap_width: 60
        date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P'
        template: '%date | %title%note'
      old:
        section: Old
        count: 5
        wrap_width: 0
        date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P'
        template: '%date | %title%note' 

The "section" key is the default section to pull entries from. Count and section can be overridden at runtime with the `-c` and `-s` flags. Setting `section` to All will combine all sections in the output.

You can add new sections with `doing add_section section_name`. You can also create them on the fly by using the `-s section_name` flag when running `doing now`. For example, `doing now -s Misc just a random side note` would create the "just a random side note" entry in a new section called "Misc," if Misc didn't already exist.

The `tags` and `tags_bool` keys allow you to specify tags that the view is filtered by. You can list multiple tags separated by spaces, and then use `tags_bool` to specify "ALL," "ANY," or "NONE" to determine how it handles the multiple tags.

The `order` key defines the sort order of the output. This is applied _after_ the tasks are retrieved and cut off at the maximum number specified in `count`.

Regarding colors, you can use them to create very nice displays if you're outputting to a color terminal. Example:

    color:
      date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P'
      section: Currently
      count: 10
      wrap_width: 0
      template: '%boldblack%date %boldgreen| %boldwhite%title%default%note'

Outputs:

## Usage:

    doing [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

### Global options:

    --[no-]notes        - Output notes if included in the template (default: enabled)
    --version           - Display the program version
    --help              - Show help message and usage summary

### Commands:

    help           - Shows a list of commands and global options
    help [command] - Shows help for any command (`doing help now`)

#### Adding entries:

    now      - Add an entry
    later    - Add an item to the Later section
    done     - Add a completed item with @done(date). No argument finishes last entry.

The `doing now` command can accept `-s section_name` to send the new entry straight to a non-default section. 

`doing done` is used to add an entry that you've already completed. Like `now`, you can specify a section with `-s section_name`. You can also skip straight to Archive with `-a`.

You can also backdate entries using natural language with `--back 15m` or `--back "3/15 3pm"`. That will modify the timestamp of the entry. When used with `doing done`, this allows time intervals to be accurately counted when entering items after the fact.

All of these commands accept a `-e` argument. This opens your command line editor as defined in the environment variable `$EDITOR`. Add your entry, save the temp file and close it, and the new entry will be added. Anything after the first line is included as a note on the entry.

#### Modifying entries:

    finish      - Mark last X entries as @done
    tag         - Tag last entry

`doing finish` by itself is the same as `doing done` by itself. It adds `@done(timestamp)` to the last entry. It also accepts a numeric argument to complete X number of tasks back in history. Add `-a` to also archive the affected entries.

`tag` adds one or more tags to the last entry, or specify a count with `-c X`. Tags are specified as basic arguments, separated by spaces. For example:

    doing tag -c 3 client cancelled

... will mark the last three entries as "@client @cancelled." Add `-r` as a switch to remove the listed tags instead.

#### Displaying entries:

    show     - List all entries
    recent   - List recent entries
    today    - List entries from today
    last     - Show the last entry

`doing show` on its own will list all entries in the "Currently" section. Add a section name as an argument to display that section instead. Use "all" to display all entries from all sections.

You can filter the `show` command by tags. Simply list them after the section name (or "all"). The boolean defaults to "ANY," meaning any entry that contains any of the listed tags will be shown. You can use `-b ALL` or `-b NONE` to change the filtering behavior: `doing show all done cancelled -b NONE` will show all tasks from all sections that do not have either "@done" or "@cancelled" tags.

Use `-c X` to limit the displayed results. Combine it with `-a newest` or `-a oldest` to choose which chronological end it trims from. You can also set the sort order of the output with `-s asc` or `-s desc`.

The `show` command can also show the time spent on a task if it has a `@done(date)` tag with the `-t` option. This requires that you include a `%interval` token in template -> default in the config. You can also include `@start(date)` tags, which override the timestamp when calculating the intervals.

If you have a use for it, you can use `--csv` on the show or view commands to output the results as a comma-separated CSV to STDOUT. Redirect to a file to save it: `doing show all done --csv > ~/Desktop/done.csv`.

#### Views

    view     - Display a user-created view
    views    - List available custom views

Display any of the custom views you make in `~/.doingrc` with the `view` command. Use `doing views` to get a list of available views. Any time a section or view is specified on the command line, fuzzy matching will be used to find the closest match. Thus, `lat` will match `Later`, etc..

#### Sections

    sections    - List sections
    choose      - Select a section to display from a menu
    add_section - Add a new section to the "doing" file

#### Utilities

    archive  - Move entries between sections
    open     - Open the "doing" file in an editor (OS X)
    config   - Edit the default configuration

#### Archiving

    COMMAND OPTIONS
        -k, --keep=arg - Count to keep (ignored if archiving by tag) (default: 5)
        -t, --to=arg   - Move entries to (default: Archive)
        -b, --bool=arg - Tag boolean (default: AND)

The `archive` command will move entries from one section (default: Currently) to another section (default: Archive). 

`doing archive` on its own will move all but the most recent 5 entries from currently into the archive.

`doing archive other_section` will archive from "other_section" to Archive.

`doing archive other_section -t alternate` will move from "other_section" to "alternate." You can use the `-k` flag on any of these to change the number of items to leave behind. To move everything, use `-k 0`.

You can also use tags to archive. You define the section first, and anything following it is treated as tags. If your first argument starts with "@", it will assume all sections and assume any following arguments are tags.

By default tag archiving uses an "AND" boolean, meaning all the tags listed must exist on the entry for it to be moved. You can change this behavior with `-b OR` or `-b NONE` ("ALL" and "ANY" also work). 

Example: Archive all Currently items for @client that are marked @done

    doing archive @client @done

## Extras

### Bash completion

See the file `doing.completion.bash` in the git repository for full bash completion. Thanks to [fcrespo82](https://github.com/fcrespo82) for getting it [started](https://gist.github.com/fcrespo82/9609318).

### Launchbar

The previous incarnation of `doing` had a [LaunchBar](http://obdev.at/launchbar/) action that I used frequently. The Day One popup has mostly replaced that for me, but only because I have a system that connects it to my WWID file. However, I've still found a place for adding WWID entries without including them in my journal, and LaunchBar is the perfect way to do that for me.

All you need is an AppleScript saved at "~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions/Doing.scpt". It should look like this:


    on handle_string(message)
        -- get the input from LaunchBar
        if message is "?" then
            -- if the input is just "?" display the last three entries
            set _doing to do shell script "/usr/bin/doing recent 3"
            tell application "LaunchBar" to display in large type _doing
        else
            -- otherwise, create a new entry using the input
            do shell script "/usr/bin/doing now " & quoted form of message
        end if
        
    end handle_string


Evan Lovely has [converted this to an Alfred workflow as well](http://www.evanlovely.com/blog/technology/alfred-for-terpstras-doing/).

## Troubleshooting

### Errors after "Successfully installed..."

If you get errors in the terminal immediately after a message like:

    Successfully installed doing-x.x.x
    2 gems installed

...it may just be documentation related. If running `doing` works, you can ignore them. If not, try running the install command again with `--no-document`:

    $ gem install --no-document doing

### Command not found

If running `doing` after a successful install gives you a "command not found" error, then your gem path isn't in your $PATH, meaning the system can't find it. To locate the gem and link it into your path, you can try this:

    cd $GEM_PATH/bin
    ln -s doing /usr/local/bin/

Then try running `doing` and see if it works.

### Encoding errors

Ruby is rife with encoding inconsistencies across platforms and versions. Feel free to file issues (see below).

### Support

I'm not making any money on `doing`, and I don't plan to spend a lot of time fixing errors on an array of operating systems and platforms I don't even have access to. You'll probably have to solve some things on your own.

That said, you can get support from other users (and occasionally me) on GitHub. If you run into a replicatable issue in your environment, please [post an issue](https://github.com/ttscoff/doing/issues) and include your platform, OS version, and the result of `ruby -v`, along with a copy/paste of the error message.

Please try not to email me directly about GitHub projects.
